# strStr
***
strStr (leetcode lintcode)

```
For a given source string and a target string, you should output the first index(from 0) of target string in source string.

If target does not exist in source, just return -1.  

Clarification  
- Do I need to implement KMP Algorithm in a real interview?
- Not necessary. When you meet this problem in a real interview, the interviewer may just want to test your basic implementation ability. But make sure your confirm with the interviewer first.

Example
If source = "source" and target = "target", return -1.
If source = "abcdabcdefg" and target = "bcd", return 1.

Challenge 
O(n2) is acceptable. Can you implement an O(n) algorithm? (hint: KMP)
```
