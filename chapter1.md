Reverse Words in a String ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/) [lintcode](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/reverse-words-in-a-string/))

```
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

Clarification
- What constitutes a word?
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.

- Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
